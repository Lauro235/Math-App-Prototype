# Math-App-Prototype

## Description

This is a simple addition app built to help children learn the procedure of carrying over numbers in addition.

## Purpose

As a child I always found maths difficult and sometimes, it just takes some time going through the procedure a little before you really start to build confidence.
This app aims to build confidence in primary aged children when they're learning Addition.

## Tech stack

- HTML
- scss
- JavaScript

## Challenges

I focused on creating and compiling a sass app. While I built it with a local set up. I had to modify it to Jekyll in order to deploy to Github Pages.
This wasn't too tough however it seems github doesn't allow sound sources to be played in a website. There should be celebratory sound each time a question
is answered correctly.

## Next steps

I'd love to adapt this idea and create something similar in subtraction, division and multiplication, I would consider different deployment options next time 
to so as to allow for sound.

Thanks for dropping by!
